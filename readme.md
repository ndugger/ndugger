### Thanks for stopping by!

Apologies for the mess, I use github as my personal sandbox for exploring ideas. 
Most of these repositories should not be taken seriously, but feel free to poke around.

I'm currently building [a tool](https://github.com/ndugger/webmake) 
that compiles TypeScript into HTML Modules, which is an early-stage proposal. It shouldn't be 
taken seriously, but I do have a working prototype running locally, which was exciting!

Ask me about Web Components!
